ikichigau genjitsu to shinjitsu
ketsuryuu ga hashiru gin’iro no kiseki
	you misunderstood “reality“ and “ truth“
	my bloodstream races from a silvery remnant

chotto tokubetsusei no unmei nanda tte
shuusoku ten ni muke hashiru fukakutei settei
	and i know that it’s a slightly unusual fate
	i run towards the point of recovery, a theorem of uncertainty

genshi no chiri made netsuryou ni shite shimae
	until the atoms turn to dust i will keep heating it up

ryuusenkei no genjitsu to sono chi ni kizamu myakudou wo
fuzaketa ketsuron wo yurusu hitsuyousei ga nai
	i will engrave that streamlined reality and pulse into my blood
	there’s no need to allow such foolish conclusions

seiron toka rifujin toka anmari kankeinai ne
kotae dattara koko ni aru ze
	Sound arguments or unreasonableness barely matter
	in this case, if the answer is right here

tatta hitotsu no ronriteki kiketsu sa toku areba ii
	there needs to be only one logical consequence – and fast!

iikagen ni yume kara sameta hou ga ii
kotoba wo kasaneru no wa amari ii yarikata ja nai
	you better wake up from this fleeting dream
	and it’s not exactly a good way to pile up the words

yotei chouwa datte sonna ni kantan dewa nai
happii endo made machigaerarenai kara sa
	even preestablished harmony isn’t that simple 
	but i cannot be mistaken until i reach my happy end

sekai no hate made kowashi tsukushite misete
	until the end of the world, i‘ll show you i strive for destruction

kanjou no kiretsu ni kamisama no saihai wo nosete
fuzaketa unmei wo tsuranukeba ii kara
	in the rift of my emotions, i will follow God’s lead
	because i will go through with this messed up fate

genshi no chiri made netsuryou ni shite shimae
	until the atoms turn to dust i will keep heating it up

ryuusenkei no genjitsu to sono chi ni kizamu myakudou wo
fuzaketa ketsuron wo yurusu hitsuyousei ga nai
	i will engrave that streamlined reality and pulse into my blood
	there is no need to allow such foolish conclusions

kachikan toka seigiron toka anmari kankeinai ne
kotae dattara koko ni aru ze
	moral concepts or the theory of justice barely matter 
	in this case, if the answer is right here

tatta hitotsu no ronriteki kiketsu sa toku areba ii
	there needs to be only one logical consequence – and fast!
