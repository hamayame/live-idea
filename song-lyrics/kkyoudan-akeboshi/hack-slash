kimarikitta sentakushi
douse onaji sa
	the choices we made 
	were always the same in the end

seorii wa itsu datte
bokura wo uragitte yuku
	and our theory has always
	come to betray us somehow

kanjouron teido dewa kata wa tsukanai ze
nozomu mirai ga aru nara
	i cannot use emotional arguments excessively, so
	if the desired future does exist

gisei to kakugo ga hitsuyou da
	sacrifice and determination are inevitable

waraenai kedo
kimi mo sou omou darou?
	you’re not smiling but
	don’t you think the same?

sonna mon sa
	about those things

yume ya kibou ya gensou dake ja
kakudo ga hitotsu mo tari yashinai
	dreams and hopes are mere illusions
	my determination alone is not enough

amae mo yurusa mo shin’ai mo
shousha no zeitakuhin de shika nai
	overreliance, forgiveness, affection
	are not the luxury of a winner alone

subete wo oeteshimau made wa
nani mo shiranai hou ga ii
	until i have brought everything to a close
	i’m better off not knowing anything

tochuu keika ni wa imi ga nai
saigo ga ichiban daiji dakara sa
	even the current process doesn’t matter
	because the end is most important

risuku wo aisenai yatsu ni
hohoemu kami wa inai
	for those who don’t love the risk
	there’s no benevolent god

aitsura tabun dakedo
kanari seikaku warui ze
	but they probably have
	a pretty fucked up personality

yasashisa de genjou wa ugokanai
	kindness will not change the situation we’re in

aishita sekai shinjita mirai
boku ni hitsuyou na mono dewa nai
	the world i loved, the future i believed in
	to me, there‘s no need for them anymore

sasshou ryoku sae areba
daitai wa umaku iku koto ga ooi
	even if i had the power to kill
	on the whole, it often went well

subete wo sukuu nante ima sugu
akirameta hou ga ii n ja nai?
	but saving everything right now…
	shouldn’t we just give it up?

tadashii tte koto wa itsu demo
daitai ichiban zankoku dakara sa
	because the “right“ things are
	always the cruelest ones

kakujitsu ni itte zutsu tsumiagero
tejun wo mamoru yatsu wo warae
	i rebuild my certainty one-handedly
	while laughing at the guy keeping order

kimi no seigi wo shoumei shite
kureru hito wa arawarenai
	you don’t appear as a person who
	could prove his justice to me

subete no genjitsu ni wa
kansei toiu mono ga hataraku
	the entire reality acts as
	something called inertia

ugokidashita mono wa sugu ni wa
tomarenai mono nanda
	all of the things that moved have
	suddenly become unstoppable 

kudaranai mono ga nokotte iku
riyuu nante tatta sore dake
	now the boring things will remain
	and that‘s the only reason there is

taisou na sutoorii nante
kono teido no mono de shika nai kara sa
	because of this exaggerated story 
	we don’t have a choice with things on this scale
