Denryuu no you na senmei na eizou wa
Kuuchuu ni ukabu kanjou ni hibiita
	An image, vivid like an electric current,
	Floats in the air. It echoed in my emotions.

Mayoisou na hibi no naka de
Mezasu hari wa juuniji wo sashita
	In those days of confusion,
	The needle I aim for pointed to 12 o’ clock.

Tsukiyo ga kirameku	
	The moonlit night twinkles.

Shunkan no naka ikidzuku shoudou
Noizu ni naru kanjou wo hai shite
	Caught in the moment, the panting impulses
	Turn into noise, abolishing emotion,

Mayou koto wa nani mo nai to
Tsuyoku tsuyoku kanjita kara
	Because strongly, strongly, I had the feeling
	That there was nothing to hesitate over.

Ame ni netsu wo ubawarete mo
	Even if the rain takes the heat from you,

Kagiri no aru myakudou hateru made kesanai de aruke
Kono te ga fureta to shite kodoku no saki ga aru darou ka
	Until the pulsations reach the end of their limited time, don’t extinguish them – walk on.
	If these hands could touch it, is there anything beyond this loneliness?

Matta mama no hanshakou wa
Toki wo tometa gensou no you ni
	The reflections of light that danced about
	Stopped time, just like a mirage.

Onaji mama de irareru no wa
Ishi to ato wa shinjitsu dake
	With being able to stay the same
	As my purpose, all that remains is reality.

Kikoenakute mo todoku no ka na
	Even if it isn’t heard, perhaps it will reach.

Mugen ni kanjiru hodo tashika na mono mo kieru naraba
Ima dake demo ii kara sekai wo subete kanjiru dake
	If everything certain will disappear to the point where the loss will be felt forever,
	Even if it’s just for this moment, it’s okay, so all there is to do is to feel the entire world.
