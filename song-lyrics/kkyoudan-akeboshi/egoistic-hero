	reading the flow, i clench my fist and make up my mind

kono gouon ni isso ware wo ushinatte shimae yo
kachi agatte iku jinsei ni
	i would rather lose myself inside this roar
	the life that wins and rises

imi nante aru ka wakaranai?

	is meaningful, don’t you know?
	if i came to lose myself in this roar then
