inochi no mitsudo wo hakaru you ni aishiteta
yorisoenai kakudo de kizutsuku no ni
	i loved you enough to measure the weight of life
	though i did not cling to my position, i got hurt

minamo ni yurarete shizumu mitanai tsuki ga
futari wo terashite
	swaying on the water surface and sinking, the waning moon 
	shines on the both of us

tooku no hoshizora todokanai kyori ni made
utsukushiku mo nai kyou ni yotte michidzure
	not reaching far into the distance of this starry sky
	a companion that intoxicates me on this distasteful banquet

minamo ni yurarete shizumu mitanai tsuki ni
kataomoi shite yo boku no sei ni shite
	swaying on the water surface and sinking, to the waning moon
	my unrequited love, i am to blame

machigai bakari erabi tsudzukete iru
nakitai yoru ni
	i only keep chosing what mistakes to make
	at night when i want to cry

tsukimiru you ni omoetanara
kotae nante iranai tte ieta hazu sa
	if only i could remember so that i can look at the moon
	i should have just said i don’t need an answer

te wo hanashite ochiru yume wa
kimi no yubi ni shimitsuita setsunaku fukai ao
	after letting go of your hand, the dream i fall into
	ingrained into your finger,a deep, painful indigo

kowareta bakari no kakera de te wo kiru
nagameru bakari de kitto ato ni naru
	the broken pieces only cut my fingers
	just by looking at them, they’ll surely leave scars

kimi nanka tte hanareru riyuu wo sagasu no ni
mata chikadzuite iku, doushitara ii?
	i’m searching for a reason for you to leave me and yet
	we’re becoming closer again, what should i do?

tsukimiru you ni omoetanara
ima mo sono tokoro ni itadarou ka tte waratte
	if i remembered it like watching the moon
	why have i been at that place until now, i laugh

te wo nobashite ochiru yume wa
kimi no yubi ni shimitsuita hakanaku fukai ao
	after letting go of your hand, the dream i fall into
	ingrained into your finger, a deep, endless indigo
