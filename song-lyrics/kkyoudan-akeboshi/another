akenai yoru mitai da
kokyuu sae wazurawashii
	what seems like an endless night
	makes it difficult breathing 

ruupu suru kudou on dake ga
kodou no you ni yasashii
	only the drive sound repeats 
	gently, like this heartbeat

kamisama, doushite boku dake konna ni fukanzen ni shita no?
aisaretai to negau koto kowasaretai to nageku koto
	God, why have you only made me an incomplete being?
	i want to be loved, i lament that i want to be broken

mou, iya nanda shoudou ga
shinzou wo toridashite ugokenaku shite yo, douka
	again, this sickening impulse
	has ripped out my heart, so please just make it stop

cry out
kogaretakunai yo
	cry out
	i don’t want to yearn for it

iki wo hisomeru you ni naite
miageru dake nara naze umarete kitandarou
	holding my breath as i cry
	if i only ever look up, then why was i even born ?

hatenai toi mitai da
makkura na boku wo terasu
	what seems like a neverending problem
	shines on this pitch-black me

aisaretai to negawaseru
taiyou meita magaimono
	it makes me want to be loved 
	 a fake sun weighs me down

mou, iya nanda yowai no ga
isso mekakushi shite mitoosenaku shite yo, douka
	again, i hate being weak like this
	i’d rather be blindfolded, not foreseeing anything, so please-

akaruku wa nai keredo sugaru ni wa juubun sugiru
hikari ni te wo nobashita
	it may not be bright,but clinging to it is more than enough
	i reach out to the light

cry out
kanjitakunai yo
	cry out
	i don’t want to feel this

michi wo mitomeru you ni daite
tebanasu dake nara naze suki da to waratta no?
	seeing the way as i hold it close
	if it’s just giving up, why do i smile and say that i like it?

dareka ga itta “shiawase ni naru kenri” wo koushi shite ikite ii yo ne,
boku datte
	someone once said “everyone deserves to become happy in life“,
	that counts even for me

mou, iya nanda shoudou ga
shinzou wo toridashite ugokenaku shite yo, douka
	again, this sickening impulse
	has ripped out my heart, so please just make it stop

cry out
kogaretakunai yo
	cry out
	i don’t want to yearn for it

iki wo hisomeru you ni naite
miageru dake nara naze umarete kitandarou
	holding my breath as i cry
	if i only ever look up, then why was i even born ?
